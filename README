This software allows a server with a hardware RNG to serve random
numbers to other clients on the lan.


Dependancies:
openssl, socat, rng-tools, systemd must be installed on client, server

but you will want to disable rng-tools.service in systemd for client
because your native hardware RNG does not work. Or else why are you
using this?

This software was developed and tested with the server being
a raspberry PI.

To get the RNG working on the Raspberry pi:
1) do "sudo modprobe bcm2708-rng" to get the RNG running on the running system.

2) add a line saying "bcm2708-rng" to /etc/modules
   This will insure it keeps working when you reboot.

3) install rng-tools
   "sudo apt-get install rng-tools"

4) Edit /etc/default/rng-tools to say:

    HRNGDEVICE=/dev/hwrng
    
    then restart rng-tools.
    sudo systemctl restart rng-tools.service
    or
    sudo /etc/init.d/rng-tools restart



The client was a INTEL, without a hardware RNG, running DEBIAN.


systemd service files
in /etc/systemd/system

./client/etc/systemd/system/net-rng-tools.service
./server/etc/systemd/system/rand-server.service



after these installed on client or server:
      	    systemctl daemon-reload
	    systemctl start net-rng-tools.service #for client
	    systemctl start rand-server.service   #for server



The /etc/ssl/certs/rand-*  files should be uniquely generated
for your installation for security. You should not use my example
files.

This page:
http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/doc/socat-openssltunnel.html

describes how to generate these files.
