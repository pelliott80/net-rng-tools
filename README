This software allows a server with a hardware RNG to serve random
numbers to other clients on the lan.

No executables in this software. Everything is a systemd service file
or a bash script.

Dependancies:
openssl, socat, rng-tools, systemd, must be installed on client, server

configuration requires sed.

but you will want to disable rng-tools.service in systemd for client
because your native hardware RNG does not work. Or else why are you
using this?

This software was developed and tested with the server being
a raspberry PI.



The client was a INTEL, without a hardware RNG, running DEBIAN.


systemd service files
in /etc/systemd/system

./client/etc/systemd/system/net-rng-tools.service
./server/etc/systemd/system/rand-server.service

To install net-rng-tools coordination between the server must
be implemented! The hostname of the server must be agreed on,
as well as the TCP port used for communication. Also the SSL
keys and certificates must be distributed in a coordinated way.

Read INSTALL for instructions on how to install.


after these installed on client or server:
      	    systemctl daemon-reload
	    systemctl start net-rng-tools.service #for client
	    systemctl start rand-server.service   #for server



The /etc/ssl/certs/rand-*  files should be uniquely generated
for your installation for security. 

This page:
http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/doc/socat-openssltunnel.html

describes how to generate these files.
